Personal coding project for my OCJA course

We had a certain degree of freedom when deciding what we wanted to achieve with our projects. We had certain criteria to fulfill, such as implementing coding techniques that we learned throughout the course, as well as the option to use techniques that were out of the range of the course. These techniques would of been learned independently but fully endorsed by our class tutor.

My idea was to create a text-based game, not unlike the classic 1980's PC games like ZORK for example.

It began as a simple scrolling game run in command prompt, but after some feedback from fellow developers, a gui was created to further customize the game. The code is still a work in progress, but the game is still fully playable and the product back-log is very short. I hope to have the game completely finished by November 30th. Feel free to utilize the code and enjoy the game!
